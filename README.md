# AI-Plant-Disease-Detection

AI Plant Disease Detection is a machine learning-based project aimed at identifying plant diseases from images. This tool can assist farmers, researchers, and agricultural organizations in detecting diseases early, improving crop management, and minimizing agricultural losses.

# Features

Automated Image Analysis: Detect plant diseases from leaf images.
High Accuracy: Trained on a robust dataset for reliable predictions.
User-Friendly Interface: Simple input and output system for ease of use.
Scalable Solution: Can be adapted to include additional crops and diseases.

# Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python
Machine Learning Frameworks: TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch
Image Processing Libraries: OpenCV, PIL
Dataset: Publicly available datasets like PlantVillage or custom datasets.

# How It Works

Data Collection: Images of healthy and diseased plant leaves.
Preprocessing: Image resizing, normalization, and augmentation for better model training.
Model Training: A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is trained to classify diseases.
Prediction: The model predicts the disease type when given a new leaf image.
Output: Displays the disease name and confidence level.

# Usage

Upload an image of a plant leaf through the interface.
The model processes the image and displays the disease detected.

# Future Enhancements

Integration with mobile apps for on-field usage.
Expand dataset for more plant species and diseases.
Real-time disease detection via video feeds.
